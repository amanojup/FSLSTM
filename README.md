This paper, titled "Traffic Congestion Prediction using Feature Series LSTM Neural Network (FSLSTMNN) and a new Congestion Index" [1], presents a FSLSTMNN to predict traffic congestion level. The code for the FSLSTMNN and comparative model hae been uploaded here. However, please note that due to copyright issues, it is advisable to contact the authors directly to obtain the code.
